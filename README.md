# Lecture 4: **2D Graphics Programming, Part 1**

The latest commit will be the finished code at the end of class.  If you are intending to implement this program while watching the lecture video, you should checkout the commit labeled `pre-class commit`  to get the starter code.

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js 20.17.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or newer) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

I also recommend you install the following useful VS Code extensions:

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) (makes source control easier)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (static code analysis tool that can flag errors)
- [JavaScript Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly) (essential for real-time debugging)
- [WebGL GLSL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raczzalan.webgl-glsl-editor) (used for programming shaders later in the course)

## Running

You will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

Your program should open in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
